Using the basic structure of Art Assignment bot, this performance/workshop/event would invite participants to attend a bot-driven art school. Students would be assigned to make drawings from unique prompts such as "Construct a drawing about accidents" and "Make a drawing exploring eighths". Once finished, the drawings, made on specially-crafted worksheets, will be scanned and posted to the @artassignbot account in realtime. Additional possibilities include posting to Mechanical Turk for grading before being posted to Twitter, and a small exhibition of the finished drawings somewhere at the festival.

PURCHASES:
- paper for assignments
- pens/markers for drawing
- red pen to mark grade
- copy stand with light
	- could build own using makerslide, ball head (B&H# JOBH201EN
	  or BEBH00), adjustable LED lights, flat surface, etc
